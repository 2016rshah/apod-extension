Web extension to show the latest Astronomy Picture of the Day

## Plans
Here are the plans I have for this extension:

-Add the ability to look at previous images

-Improve styling

-Upload it to Firefox Addons

## Contributing
If you want to help, please do. I don't know how to use GitHub very well. So it would be great.
